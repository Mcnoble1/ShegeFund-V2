# ShegeFund: Decentralized Fundraising Platform

ShegeFund is a Decentralized Fundraising Platform built on the Web5 ecosystem. It allows users to create fundraising campaigns and share them with others to seek donations. Users can also browse existing campaigns and make donations directly through the platform. By leveraging the power of decentralized technologies like DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers), DWN (Decentralized Web Network), and protocols, ShegeFund ensures transparency, and privacy in the fundraising process.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mcnoble1/ShegeFund-V2

The web5 code is located in the ```components/Dashboard/index.tsx```
